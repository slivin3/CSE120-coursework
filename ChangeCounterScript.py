#Instructions: Write a program that accepts a dollar amount 0.00 and 0.99 as an input and display exact changes for this amount using the minimum number of coins.
#For example, $0.97 shows 3 quarters, 2 dimes, and 2 pennies.


##Note to self:**Use multiple loops of Modulus "%" in Python to find out how many of each denomination coin will be used.
